Hi, my name is Akshay Badagabettu. I am first year graduate student pursuing an MS in Artificial Intelligence Engineering (conc. in Robotics). I work with Dr. Amir Barati Farimani in the Mechanical and Artificial Intellligence Lab (MAIL).

I am interested in Natural Language Processing, particularly in the field of autonomous agents and iterative refining of outputs produced by LLMs. I am currently working on generating 3D CAD models using only natural language prompts. I am also interested in the areas of code generation and Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

I completed my undergrad at Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India and interned at Sandvik Mining and Rock Technology as a Mechanical and Machine Learning Engineer. If you are interested in my projects or research areas, feel free to reach out to me via my email (abadagab@andrew.cmu.edu)
